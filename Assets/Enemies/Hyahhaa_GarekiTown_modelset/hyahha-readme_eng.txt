Hyahaa- Easy Outlaw

It is an outlaw model of Post Apocalypse with a very familiar design for Japanese people.

Easy to understand bad face

Lightness about 10 thousand polygons

Multiple color variations Various customization is possible with texture and blend shape.

It is supposed to make an Winpy enemy character that gives priority to quantity rather than quality for action games.

I will ship a low resolution texture for mobile.

Blend shape can change hair size, face shape, physique, some equipment.

Part of the equipment is controlled with a bone. Physical calculations can be charged or reduced to make it in the body.

Textures of different colors are registered in the material.
You can assign different materials for each shirt and pants.
Textures and materials are in the colorvari folder.


For some materials, I use a custom shader with a Standard shader on both sides.
This is a brief remodeling just adding a cull off to the Standard Shader, and there should be no hindrance to using post effects together.

VR chat also works.
You can upload with a blend shape and transform with a different physique and equipment.
